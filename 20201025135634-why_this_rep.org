#+title: why this rep

It is said that we were thinking too much but doing too little.

I see the opposite. We are thinking too little therefore doing too
little. Too many times, we stop deeper conversation just because I do
not want to directly say something about your arguments lack some
consideration on something. At that point, I stop thinking. As a
result, I stop doing.
