* Cross the Bering Strait

The closest official port to the Bering Strait in Russia’s Far East is Providenia.  The distance across the Bering Sea from Alaska to Providenia is 400 km.  This stretch is broken by St. Lawrence Island (American) which lies 200 km out from Alaska.  The island is 125 km long, and it is 75 km from Russia.

A crossing via this route would necessitate the ability to navigate 200 km of open stormy water.  It is also necessary to receive permission from the Russian government to arrive in Providenia in a small boat (a process which takes about a year).
