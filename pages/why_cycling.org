#+TITLE: why cycling

** To me part of reason is because of Serotonin.
 
How to increase serotonin in the human brain without drugs
Young cite:young2007increase introduces four methods to increase Serotonin without using drag: improvement in mood, exposed to sunlight,
exercise, and good diet.

And I found cycling is my best way to achieve this. As long as I am on
the bike, I feel good. I can see the fantastic surrounding which is
not available to most people in the neighborhood. Second, I will be
exposed the sun and I cannot escape that. Third, cycling is a sport
and it can be extremely brute when I perform at my threshold level.
And finally, being in a competitive cycling group, I need to find good
food to energize my body after hard workout to be competitive.
