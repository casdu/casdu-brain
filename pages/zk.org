** Difference between ZK and Wiki
#+begin_quote chapter 12
Because the slip-box is not intended to be an encyclopaedia, but a
tool to think with, we don’t need to worry about completeness. We
don’t need to write anything down just to bridge a gap in a note
sequence. We only write if it helps us with our own thinking.

Only when the gaps become obvious in the next step, it is time to fill
them up.
** be careful with tag

...the references between the notes are much more
important than the references from the index to a single note.

another consideration on a note
