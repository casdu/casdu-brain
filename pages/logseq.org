#+TITLE: logseq

** search panel is good
*** pages,files, then searching all the content
** Issue
*** After input [[| , if there's no page generated, it will create a a link: `[[A non-exist file]]`. The Org-mode user would expect the result is `[[FILE-PATH][A non-exist file]]`
*** All the notes within the scope of TEAM ZK are not automatica pick up by org-roam. However, manual visiting a file and save a file can triggle the index process within Org-roam.
** My tasks
*** I will test logseq locally, i.e. build logseq and run the server to see how's going
*** tesing file name change
**** will it update all the links pointing to the old file? This is more Org-roam related issue
