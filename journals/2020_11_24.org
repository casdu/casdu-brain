** [[file:../pages/logseq.org][logseq]]  issue with the name
*** possible to use ~20201028153926.org~ as file name?
**** it's okay for org-roam to create from local Emacs repo
**** it's kinda mess now:
***** in the ~pages/*~ the file name is arbitary and including chinese file name, which I do not intend to do so. It's just my personal perference to choose all ascii characters to name a file
***** it's okay to write thoughts into pages without consideration of filename, when more mature pages are done, then move the pages using Emacs locallly
