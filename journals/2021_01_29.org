** This is a test from logseq local version.
*** Compared with the online version
**** I feel that it is more stable more fast and I do not need to worry about losing the notes anymore
*** I do want to share this software with casduer
**** write an introduction on what's ZK
**** write an introduction on Logseq
**** write an [[introduction on collaboration]]
** Issue observed
*** preference is not saved
Every time the software opened, it will set the prefer format as markdown mode instead of org-mode
**** for example, if I close the software and reopen it to this repo
I will not be able to use `org-mode` format. After manually setup the preference again, it will set the format as `org-mode`. I think this is an issue with the preference order.
