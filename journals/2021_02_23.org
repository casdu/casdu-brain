What's a better solution?

The goal is kinda weird and conflicts with the goals or TRâ€™s training plans.

In my opinion, my goal is very clear. Try to raise the number during the last minute of the RAMP test.

I set this goal because I do not have any chance to race. Maybe one in a year or once in two years. This is not to say that I do not like race. I like to race but I do not have this privilege too often. Instead, I am seeking a tangible goal.

For example, the goal of the specialty phase is *not* to raise your FTP

This is the reason why I avoid specialty phase because I found that I do not have too much FTP progress after finishing this.

Short power build emphasizes shorter efforts.

This is the reason why I prefer short power because I think the RAMP test is more correlated to short maximum power.

What you are asking is to get good at one test

Exactly. I am not sure by setting a clear and defined goal would help achieving this goal better or not.

you might mentally burn out.

This is why I cannot consistently train at a relatively higher training session in the past. I am trying to add more endurance training with the hope to reduce the physical stress during the hard sessions.  As I said, I will look at it very closely and adjust my training accordingly.
