** forget to tell my friend that we should change the path
ref: wr

I was riding 1st of the group, and my friend who followed me. When I saw a car parking on the shoulder of the road, I only used the hand gesture to tell my friend. But, my friend did not receive the message. My friend crushed on the back of the car.
